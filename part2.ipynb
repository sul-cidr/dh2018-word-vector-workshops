       " 'Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the\\r\\nwhalemen, among whom he was a very great favourite.',\n",
       " 'He had been a\\r\\nsailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had\\r\\ndedicated his life to the ministry.',\n",
       " \"At the time I now write of,\\r\\nFather Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort\\r\\nof old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for\\r\\namong all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild\\r\\ngleams of a newly developing bloom--the spring verdure peeping forth\\r\\neven beneath February's snow.\",\n",
       " 'No one having previously heard his\\r\\nhistory, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the\\r\\nutmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical\\r\\npeculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life\\r\\nhe had led.',\n",
       " 'When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,\\r\\nand certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran\\r\\ndown with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed\\r\\nalmost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had\\r\\nabsorbed.',\n",
       " 'However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one\\r\\nremoved, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when,\\r\\narrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.',\n",
       " 'Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\\r\\nregular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the\\r\\nfloor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the\\r\\narchitect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and\\r\\nfinished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular\\r\\nside ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.',\n",
       " 'The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome\\r\\npair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself\\r\\nnicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole\\r\\ncontrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no\\r\\nmeans in bad taste.',\n",
       " 'Halting for an instant at the foot of the\\r\\nladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the\\r\\nman-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly\\r\\nsailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted\\r\\nthe steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.',\n",
       " 'The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case\\r\\nwith swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were\\r\\nof wood, so that at every step there was a joint.',\n",
       " 'At my first\\r\\nglimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient\\r\\nfor a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.',\n",
       " 'For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height,\\r\\nslowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up\\r\\nthe ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving\\r\\nhim impregnable in his little Quebec.',\n",
       " 'I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.',\n",
       " 'Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and\\r\\nsanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\\r\\nmere tricks of the stage.',\n",
       " 'No, thought I, there must be some sober\\r\\nreason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something\\r\\nunseen.',\n",
       " 'Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he\\r\\nsignifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward\\r\\nworldly ties and connexions?',\n",
       " 'Yes, for replenished with the meat and\\r\\nwine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is\\r\\na self-containing stronghold--a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a\\r\\nperennial well of water within the walls.',\n",
       " \"But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\\r\\nborrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings.\",\n",
       " 'Between the marble\\r\\ncenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its\\r\\nback was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship\\r\\nbeating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and\\r\\nsnowy breakers.',\n",
       " \"But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling\\r\\nclouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed\\r\\nforth an angel's face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of\\r\\nradiance upon the ship's tossed deck, something like that silver\\r\\nplate now inserted into the Victory's plank where Nelson fell.\",\n",
       " '\"Ah,\\r\\nnoble ship,\" the angel seemed to say, \"beat on, beat on, thou noble\\r\\nship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo!',\n",
       " 'the sun is breaking through; the\\r\\nclouds are rolling off--serenest azure is at hand.\"',\n",
       " 'Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\\r\\nhad achieved the ladder and the picture.',\n",
       " \"Its panelled front was in\\r\\nthe likeness of a ship's bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\\r\\nprojecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship's\\r\\nfiddle-headed beak.\",\n",
       " \"What could be more full of meaning?--for the pulpit is ever this\\r\\nearth's foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit\\r\\nleads the world.\",\n",
       " \"From thence it is the storm of God's quick wrath is\\r\\nfirst descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt.\",\n",
       " 'From\\r\\nthence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for\\r\\nfavourable winds.',\n",
       " \"Yes, the world's a ship on its passage out, and not\\r\\na voyage complete; and the pulpit is its prow.\",\n",
       " 'CHAPTER 9\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sermon.',\n",
       " 'Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority\\r\\nordered the scattered people to condense.',\n",

       " \"He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit's bows, folded his\\r\\nlarge brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and\\r\\noffered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying\\r\\nat the bottom of the sea.\",\n",
       " 'This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of\\r\\na bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog--in such tones he\\r\\ncommenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards\\r\\nthe concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and\\r\\njoy--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The ribs and terrors in the whale,\\r\\nArched over me a dismal gloom,\\r\\nWhile all God\\'s sun-lit waves rolled by,\\r\\nAnd lift me deepening down to doom.',\n",
